While teaching buildups for SynShop, the Las vegas Hackerspace, I noticed that it's really hard to figure out when all students are completed with a step.  BuildUP is an experimental Student-Teacher communication device that the students activate at the start of step.  A LED will blink slowly at first, then more rapidly as time goes on.  This provides feedback to the instructor on which students are having problems with a particular step.
